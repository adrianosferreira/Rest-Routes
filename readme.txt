Building custom endpoints for WP REST API made easy.

== Description ==

Have you ever thought in the possibility of having a way to extend the WP REST API without touching a single line of PHP? That can be easily done with Rest Routes! It lets you build fresh new endpoints with custom filters and output. All from inside of the WP dashboard side.

A couple of available filters:

*   Default and Custom Post Types
*   Default Taxonomies
*   Post Status
*   Post Parent
*   Post ID
*   Post Author
*   Ordering
*   Limit & Offset

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/rest-routes` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
